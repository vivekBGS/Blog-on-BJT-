BJTs (Bipolar Junction Transistors)
What IS BJT? 
A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a type of transistor that uses both electrons and holes as charge carriers. It consists of three layers of semiconductor material, and the flow of current between these layers can be controlled by applying a voltage to a control terminal. BJTs are used in a variety of electronic circuits, including amplifiers, switches, and more. They are classified as either NPN or PNP, depending on the arrangement of the layers of semiconductor material. In an NPN BJT, the two outer layers are made of a type of semiconductor called "n-type," and the middle layer is made of "p-type" semiconductor. In a PNP BJT, the two outer layers are made of "p-type" semiconductor and the middle layer is made of "n-type" semiconductor.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Some basic concepts related to bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are:
Amplification: BJTs can be used as amplifiers, where a small input signal is amplified to a larger output signal.
Switching: BJTs can also be used as switches, where the flow of current between two points in a circuit can be controlled by applying a voltage to the control terminal
NPN and PNP transistors: BJTs are classified as either NPN or PNP, depending on the arrangement of the layers of semiconductor material. In an NPN BJT, the two outer layers are made of "n-type" semiconductor and the middle layer is made of "p-type" semiconductor. In a PNP BJT, the two outer layers are made of "p-type" semiconductor and the middle layer is made of "n-type" semiconductor.
Biasing: The process of setting the operating point of a BJT is called biasing. There are several different biasing configurations that can be used to achieve the desired performance in a circuit.
Active and saturation regions: The BJT operates in different regions depending on the current and voltage applied to the transistor. The active region is the region where the transistor is amplifying the input signal, and the saturation region is the region where the transistor is fully "on" and the collector current is at its maximum value.
The Workings of BJTs are: 
The working of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) can be understood by considering the flow of charge carriers (electrons and holes) through the three layers of semiconductor material that make up the transistor.
In an NPN BJT, the two outer layers are made of "n-type" semiconductor material, which has an excess of electrons. The middle layer is made of "p-type" semiconductor material, which has a deficiency of electrons (also known as holes). The "p-type" layer is sandwiched between the two "n-type" layers, creating a p-n-p structure.
When a voltage is applied to the base terminal of an NPN BJT, it creates a current of electrons that flow from the emitter to the base. This current of electrons causes a corresponding current of holes to flow from the base to the collector. As a result, a current of electrons flows from the collector to the emitter, creating a collector 
The working of a PNP BJT is similar, but the layers of semiconductor material are arranged in the opposite order (n-p-n instead of p-n-p). In a PNP BJT, the base current is a flow of holes from the base to the emitter, which causes a corresponding flow of electrons from the collector to the base, creating a collector current.
its characteristic curve BJTs are: 
The characteristic curve of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a plot of the collector current  versus the collector-to-emitter voltage for a given value of the base current . This curve can be used to understand the behaviour of the BJT under different operating conditions.
There are several regions of operation on a BJT characteristic are: 
Active region: This is the region where the BJT is amplifying the input signal. In this region, the collector current is proportional to the base current, and the collector-to-emitter voltage is relatively small.
Saturation region: This is the region where the BJT is fully "on" and the collector current is at its maximum value. The collector-to-emitter voltage is relatively small in this region.
Cutoff region: This is the region where the BJT is fully "off" and the collector current is zero. The collector-to-emitter voltage is relatively large: 
Types of BJTs are: 

1.NPN 

An NPN transistor consists of a layer of P-type semiconductor material between two layers of N-type semiconductor material. When a small current flows through the base terminal, it controls the larger current flowing through the other two terminals, the collector and the emitter.
2.PNP 
A PNP transistor is just the opposite, with a layer of N-type semiconductor material between two layers of P-type semiconductor material. The base terminal controls the current flowing between the collector and the emitter terminals.
